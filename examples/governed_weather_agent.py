"""Governed Weather Agent Example.

Same as :mod:`examples.weather_agent` but wraps every tool call through
a :class:`GaiaGovernanceAdapter`. The adapter is composed from the
in-repo reference implementations (stub policy engine, in-memory
checkpoint bridge / receipt service / static policy binding) so the
example runs with zero external services.

This example registers two **local tools** (alongside the open-meteo
MCP tools) so governance decisions are guaranteed to trigger:

* ``clear_weather_cache`` — tagged ``blocked``. When the LLM calls
  this tool, governance short-circuits with a BLOCK decision, issues
  a signed receipt, and the tool body never runs.
* ``subscribe_weather_alerts`` — tagged ``review``. Governance opens
  a checkpoint and asks the configured reviewer (the CLI prompt in
  ``_cli_reviewer`` below). On approve the tool runs; on reject it is
  refused. Either way the resolution is logged to the receipt store.

Run::

    uv run examples/governed_weather_agent.py

Say "clear the weather cache please" to see a BLOCK decision, or
"subscribe me to severe weather alerts for Austin" to see a REVIEW
decision, or ask any normal weather question to see ALLOW decisions on
the MCP tools.

The base ``Agent`` class is **not modified**. Governance is composed
onto the agent via :class:`GovernedAgentMixin`.
