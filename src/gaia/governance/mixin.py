"""Optional mixin that adds governance to a GAIA ``Agent`` subclass.

Usage::

    from gaia import Agent
    from gaia.governance import GaiaGovernanceAdapter, GovernedAgentMixin

    class MyGovernedAgent(GovernedAgentMixin, MyAgent):
        pass

    agent = MyGovernedAgent(governance_adapter=my_adapter, actor_id="alice")

The mixin wraps :meth:`Agent._execute_tool` through ``super()``. If no
adapter is supplied it is a no-op, so adding the mixin to an agent has
zero runtime cost by default. **No edits to ``gaia.agents.base.agent``
are required.**

Decision flow
-------------

Every intercepted tool call drives the full adapter pipeline:

1. The tool call is mapped to an :class:`ActionRequest`.
2. ``adapter.govern_action`` yields a :class:`GovernanceDecision`.
3. A synthetic :class:`WorkflowTransition` is built and passed through
   ``adapter.handle_transition``.
4. **ALLOW** → the underlying ``_execute_tool`` runs.
5. **BLOCK** → the tool is short-circuited with a denied result and
   the adapter issues a BLOCK receipt.
6. **REVIEW** → a checkpoint is opened. The mixin asks the first
   available reviewer — ``self.console.confirm_tool_execution`` (GAIA's
   existing confirmation surface) or an explicit
   ``governance_reviewer`` callback — and resolves the checkpoint
   APPROVE / REJECT accordingly. An APPROVE runs the tool; a REJECT
   short-circuits. Either way, a receipt is issued.

If ``REVIEW`` decisions are returned and neither a console nor a
reviewer is available, the mixin **fails closed** and rejects the
tool. This matches the intent of the decision type ("do not execute
without review") and avoids silent pass-through.
