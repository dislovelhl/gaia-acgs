"""Optional governance layer for GAIA agents.

Provides action-level governance (ACGS-lite semantics) plus seams for
future workflow checkpoint / receipt / policy-version binding
(constitutional-swarm semantics).

This package is opt-in. Importing it has no side effects on existing
GAIA agents. To govern an agent, mix :class:`GovernedAgentMixin` into
your agent class and pass a :class:`GaiaGovernanceAdapter` via the
``governance_adapter`` keyword argument.
